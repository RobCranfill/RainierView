RainierView
===========

New version of my Windows 'gadget' to display webcam views of Mount Rainier.

So far this just shows the view from Paradise, but once the Camp Muir camera is up and running regularly,
I will add it.

This should work fine for Windows 7 and Windows Vista. 
I believe there is a way to run it on Windows 8.1, also, but haven't yet investigated that.

This project is free to use, re-distribute, re-use, whatever - as long as you don't charge any money for it.

A link is provided to the web site of the climbing club I belong to, [OSAT](http://osat.org/), which is an awesome organization, 
but I am not implying any endorsement of this software by OSAT or any other connection between me and them. :)

This is my ['product page'](http://robcranfill.net/RainierView) for this thing.
