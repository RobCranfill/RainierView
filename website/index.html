<h1>RainierView</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;A Windows 'gadget' for viewing Mount Rainier</h2>

<p>Welcome to the web page for RainierView, a free Windows 'gadget' for various Mount Rainier webcams.</p>
<p>Free as in 'free speech', <u>and</u> as in 'free lunch'. Written and distributed in tribute to my favorite
climbing club, <a href="http://www.osat.org" target="_blank">OSAT</a> - which is not connected with or responsible for this software in any way.</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>
<p class="indentedPara">You can <a href="RainierView-2.0.gadget">download the Gadget file here</a>; 
depending on what web browswer you're using you may be able to either "Open" it directly (that is, install it)
or "Save" it to your hard drive. If you save it, you will then have to go find the "RainierView-2.0.gadget"
that was downloaded, and double-click it. Either way, you will be presented with this scary notice</p>

<p class="indentedPara">I promise you there is nothing nefarious in this software - I wrote it myself - so go ahead and click "Install".</p>


<h3>Using</h3>
<p class="indentedPara">Mostly just admire and be inspired by the view of Rainier on your desktop!</p>
<p class="indentedPara">If you click on the image, four icons will appear above the upper-right edge:</p>

<p class="wayIndentedPara"><img src="WidgetControlsCloseup.PNG"/></p>

<p class="indentedPara">These are the standard gadget controls that let you (reading from the top down): 1) close the gadget; 2) toggle its size between large and small; 3) change the settings of the gadget (see 'Configuration', below); or 4) drag the gadget around on your screen.</p>
<p class="indentedPara">You can just leave this thing running on your desktop 24/7 - it doesn't use much computing resources. But if you do want to close the gadget, just click its "X" box and it will be gone. If you later want to see it again, you do not need to re-install the software - just right-click your desktop, select "Gadgets", find RainierView's icon here and double-click it, and it will be restored.</p>


<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p class="indentedPara"><i>I haven't finished this part of the documentation yet. Sorry.</i></p>


<h3>Source code</h3>
<p class="indentedPara">If you'd like to see how it works, adapt it to your own use, or just check it out (a little SCC joke, there)
you can go to my <a href="https://github.com/RobCranfill/RainierView" target="_blank">RainierView project on GitHub</a>.</p>
